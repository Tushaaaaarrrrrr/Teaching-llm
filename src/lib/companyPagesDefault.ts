${lastUpdated()}

<p>At <strong>Gen-Z IITian</strong>, we aim to provide high-quality educational content and resources to our students. Because our products are digital and delivered instantly, we maintain a clear refund and cancellation policy.</p>

${sectionHeader('01', 'No Refund Policy')}
<p style="padding:14px 18px; background:#f8fafc; border-left:4px solid #3636e8; border-radius:6px; font-style:italic; color:#475569;">"All purchases are final. We do not offer refunds once a course is purchased."</p>
<p>As our products are digital educational courses and access is granted immediately upon payment, we cannot provide any refunds or returns. Once the course material is accessed, the value is considered delivered.</p>

${sectionHeader('02', 'No Cancellation Policy')}
<p style="padding:14px 18px; background:#f8fafc; border-left:4px solid #3636e8; border-radius:6px; font-style:italic; color:#475569;">"Orders cannot be cancelled once placed."</p>
<p>Due to the automated nature of our enrollment process, once a payment is successful, the order cannot be reversed or cancelled. Access is linked to your account immediately.</p>

${sectionHeader('03', 'Reason for this Policy')}
<p>We provide access to proprietary educational content, downloadable resources, and curriculum-specific study materials. Since these materials are accessible instantly to anyone after purchase, we cannot revoke access once the content has been viewed.</p>

${sectionHeader('04', 'Duplicate Payment Resolution')}
<p>In case of a technical glitch leading to a duplicate payment for the same course, users should contact our support team immediately. Upon verification, we will initiate a refund for the duplicate transaction through the original payment method. The refund process may take <strong>5–7 business days</strong> depending on the payment gateway and your bank.</p>

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<div id="section-5">${sectionHeader('05', 'HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?')}</div>
<p><em>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>

We started Gen-Z IITian to bridge the gap between expensive coaching and self-study with a single, focused offering — disciplined live batches paired with on-demand lecture recordings, premium notes, and PYQs.</p>

${sectionHeader('02', 'What We Offer')}
<ul>
  <li><strong>Qualifier Batches</strong> — complete syllabus coverage with daily live classes, doubt sessions, and unlimited re-attempt support.</li>
  <li><strong>Term Courses (Live + Recorded)</strong> — structured Term 1, Term 2, and Diploma tracks aligned with the IITM BS curriculum.</li>
  <li><strong>Foundation Courses</strong> — for students building core concepts from the ground up.</li>
  <li><strong>Premium Notes, PYQs &amp; Formula Sheets</strong> — concise, exam-ready resources curated by top scorers.</li>
  <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> — book 1:1 sessions with IIT mentors for strategy, doubt resolution, and study plans.</li>
</ul>

${sectionHeader('03', 'Our Approach')}
<p>We believe the best learning happens when content is <strong>structured, interactive, and revisitable</strong>. Every live class is recorded and indexed, every concept is paired with practice problems, and every student gets dedicated support channels — community chat, ticketed help, and live mentorship — so no doubt goes unanswered.</p>

${sectionHeader('04', 'Why Students Choose Us')}
<ul>
  <li>Taught by educators who have cleared the same exams they teach.</li>
  <li>Transparent pricing — no hidden fees, no upsells inside the classroom.</li>

  <li>Active student community with peer support and instructor presence.</li>
